# keylogger

keylogger.py:
Python code that captures keystrokes and writes them to a file called keystrokes.txt. The code listens for both keypress and release events, but only writes the press events to the file.

logsender.py:
It sends the keystrokes.txt to the e-mail address you want. See my other repositories for Mail Sender versions.
